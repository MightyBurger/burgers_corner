Hi! I just moved in, so it's a little barren here.

You can check out the [projects](/projects) I've done or [posts](/posts) I've written.

If you're here, you might be looking for [Curveball](/projects/curveball).

So far I've only written about Curveball, but I've done a lot of other projects I want to write about soon.
